This is my completed Arcade Game Project. It's a Frogger Clone and the game objective is to get to cross the area with enemies and get to the water. More details are listed below:

Objective:
The objective is to navigate your player from the starting point to the water on the other side. If you come in contact with an enemy the character will return to the starting position. Once at the water the game will end and you will be given the option to restart. The enemies' speed will change upon each restart/reload.

Controls: 1) The arrow keys will move the player one block at a time. 2) You can go anywhere within the board.

Conclusion:

This is a simple frogger clone, try to get the other side!!

GOOD LUCK!! :)
